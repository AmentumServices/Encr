Getting Started with Encryption Wizard (EW) version 4.0.2
as of 07 Jun 2023
-----------------------------------------------------

Quick Start Guide

1.   Download and install Java SE from
        https://jdk.java.net/
     or
        https://java.com/
     (Many computers already have Java installed.)

2.   Download EW from https://mpc4.mission-planning.org or
     https://nexus.seicdevops.com/#browse/browse:Asset-Dev-BUE:BUE%20Builds%20-%20Resources%2FEncryption%20Wizard
     (requires a SEIC DevOps account).  Alternatively, check for
     additional download links at https://www.getTENS.online

3.   Open the .zip file and extract the contents.  We strongly
     recommend expanding the files rather than simply browsing
     inside the .zip file.

3a.  If on MacOS, select the files and choose File > Get Info (or
     press Command-I) and make sure the access under "Sharing and
     Permissions" includes read permission.

     Go to Settings > Security and Privacy, and change "Allow
     application downloaded from" to "Anywhere".

4.   If on MS-Windows, MacOS, or a Linux graphical desktop, double-
     click the .jar file to start.  Users on MS-Windows may also use
     the fallback .bat file if needed.

     If at a Linux command line, type "java -jar EW-*.jar"
     (using the appropriate exact file name).

     All platforms may override the Java location via the environment
     variable AFRL_EW_JAVACMD as described in the User Guide.

5.   Optionally, in MS-Windows click 'Install' under the Tools menu
     to make EW more user-friendly.  In Linux, a wrapper script can
     be generated to ease command-line use.

6.   Drag-and-drop files/folders into the EW window.

7.   Click 'Encrypt' for individually encrypted files or 'Archive'
     for a many-into-one, compressed, and encrypted file.

8.   Enter your key(s) and optionally enter metadata.

9.   Your file is now encrypted.

10.  To decrypt, drag the .wzd/.wza file into Encryption Wizard and
     click 'Decrypt' for individual files or 'Expand' to unpack an
     encrypted archive.  If installed, you may double-click the
     encrypted file.


Encryption Wizard's key shortfall remains Java's fragility with MS-Windows
smartcard (CAC/PIV Card) support.  Some layer of middleware providing the
required PKCS#11 support is typically required, even with the most recent
versions of Java, MS-Windows, and EW.

For more information, consult the Help menu within Encryption Wizard,
the enclosed Encryption Wizard User Guide (a PDF file), or our website
